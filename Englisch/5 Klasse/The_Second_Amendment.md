# The Second Amendment

Militia :

- A militia is a group of armed civilians who militarily support an army in times of emergency

- During and after the War of Independence, there were many armed militias in the United States that fought British colonial rule

- While *Federalists* argued the right of the federal government to raise a national military, Anti-federalists were worried that the goverment would use the military to oppress people

- So, the second amendment was a compromise to protect these militaias while also creating a military

- Nowadays, there are basically no important American militias; the modern police force and miltary has made this cause obsolte

infringe = take away, violent, prevent

## DC v. Heller (2008) and modern gun laws

- Brought to court by a multi-millionaire libertarian Constitutional scholar

- The first Supreme court case to rule that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to own firearms for self-defense, outside the context of a militia

- Justice Scalia argued fot this decision based on the idea that most Americans could theoretically join a militia



precendent = when a law is firstly discussted



most people don't own a gun in the USA

### So why doesn't anything really change???

- Lobbying

- money and politics

- not a priority (more issues like, inflasion and health care problems)



# Money in American politics

- Multiple court cases have allowed influence of money in American politics ...

- Such as Citizens United v. FEC (2010), in wich the court ruled that politics

- Dark Money: undisclosed amounts of money paid to PACs from mysterious sources

- Lobbying



=> National Rifle Association: Funds campaigns against gun control laws
